## Overview

This module will cover some of the most commonly used methods of analysis and inference when working with data related to people, such as performance data and organizational network data. Among other things, you will learn about:
* Typical explanatory analyses conducted on people data
* Common people-related data types 
* Common hypothesis testing methods
* Common explanatory modeling methods
* How to use graphs to model network relationships 
* How to analyze and draw inferences about people networks

You will learn from class discussions and by working through code and data examples including a final data projects where you will have a chance to put all your learning into practice.

## Learning objectives

To be able to:
* Understand basic principles of statistical inference and know how to conduct tests of difference in populations based on samples
* Understand how to conduct and interpret a suite of explanatory modeling techniques which are used to analyze common outcome types in people analytics (continuous, binary, ordinal, time-dependent)
* Understand how to construct, visualize and analyze organizational or people networks 
* Use integrated data science documents to execute analyses and explain methods and results based on all the above.

## Prework

* Register for an RStudio Cloud account at https://rstudio.cloud
* Obtain a github account at https://github.com
